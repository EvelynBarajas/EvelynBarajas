### Hi! 🙋🏻‍♀️
My name is Evelyn Barajas and I'm a junior at Heritage University majoring in Computer Science. I enjoy coding, I think is something fun and a very useful skill. I always like to learn new things and try to keep up with all the new information I learn in my classes. I've always been interested in technology and how compuetrs work which is why I was drawn to choosing Computer Science.
#### Hobbies
I enjoy drawing in my free time as well as hiking when the weather is nice and warm and I like listening to music all the time.
